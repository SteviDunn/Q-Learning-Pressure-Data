This project adapts a Robots in a Warehouse reinforcement learning example to meet the needs of the UC Davis BIRD Lab (Biologically Informed Research Lab).

The initial phase of this project involves applying a simple reinforcement learning technique, Q-learning, to locate the highest lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio in a 3-dimensional aircraft spatial matrix. This represents the first step in a larger, ongoing project
